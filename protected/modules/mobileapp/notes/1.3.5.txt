Wouldnt the google+ login come on the update for mobile app?


In my case 500+ users using installed 1.3.3 in play store if i update the mobile app module to 1.3.4, the users with ver 1.3.3 their cart shows as empty.. even though i update the app to version 1.3.4 some user may update or some user may not update. what i m saying is users with 1.3.3 gets affected with 1.3.4 app module..thats loss of business pls release a fix in such a way that users with 1.3.3 doesnt get affected


if it works, it will only for the one u have just ordered. or if it works on the older ones, 
it will shows the items that u have just ordered (latest), not the intended ones.

or this issue only on my app/server?

for cart items storing in database: i think this new implement in using the database in storing the
 cart items will cause a higher workload for the server. pls give an option to choose
  wether to use local storage or server base. cart is missing issue only occured when using shared hosting i think
