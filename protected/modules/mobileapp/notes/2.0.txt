for the offline bank deposit mobile app, customer only get receipt after checkout but did not 
get 2nd email that inform bank details. how to enable this in mobile app? Thanks :)


define change as mandatory, because when the
 customer selects cash on delivery as a payment means the change should be mandatory.


also, for the current menu categories popup, when trying to scroll up the categories, 
it scrolls the menu item page underneath it.
https://gyazo.com/9a8c94d4705c48f024a32471abff91d5


when app is on map view, then push notif arrive, it will make the app stuck. back, view and cancel button unclickable.


add client_Id in booking table


5) We added a tiny hot pepper icon image to food item to indicate the food is “hot’. it shows okay on menu list page. but in the item detail page, it did not (instead of showing the html codes).
https://gyazo.com/35785fe0cd8815ab1edb7f0d9afbb1ef (this one is good) https://gyazo.com/eb999b018f19cb0c1ee2b186abf4b1ea (not good, did not show hot pepper icon image) 

3) When use “Offline Credit Card”, the steps are very confusing… it went to the screen with 
card number only on the page.. had to click it to get a popup on “Use this card” and “Edit this card”.
 would be better to have checkbox along with two buttons on the pages (see screenshot below);
  then customers know clearly how to do without guessing or confusing.
https://gyazo.com/620ec3841754a85b2b45f2ecbb8ddc5d

Actually the best way is to show the credit card to be chosen on the same page (without going to another new page).

6) menu category list scroll up issue. I mentioned in one of previous posts.. but there is a new finding. look like it can be scrolled up when first time approaches it. After clicking a menu category, then back to the menu category list, it will scroll up the background menu food items, not the menu categories that are supposed to be scrolled up.

user can still make order when the merchant setting is close or disabling order when they click ‘click here to reorder’

Hi mate, There is a problem with the push notifications. Customers are still 
getting them in there phones even if they turn them off thro the settings how we can fix this?


When Disable Ordering from Merchant APP, 
is there way to display “Sorry, we are not taking orders right now,
 please check back in few minutes” somewhere visible. At the moment,
 a customer would not know why the ADD to order button displaying (Confusion).
 
 
Yes! Let the customer in the app have a pop-up come up asking to rate the driver after the status of
 order has been set to succesfull (or something else).
  If it’s placed through the website let is sent out a e-mail asking to rate the driver. 
  And for merchant just through the order taking app.
  
  
Think in you can add a serch option that pulls merchants that are open at this 
time in the the browse restaurant area in next update?

The problem with the push notifications. Customers are 
still getting them in their phones even if they turn them off thro the settings how we can fix this?


When we can have customers can register/sign in by phone not by mail


Can you add contact link in mobile app ? so customers can contact 
through mobile applications without having to website


also for customer can make order when clicking reorder button eventhough
 merchant has disabled the ordering. pls provide a quick fix

Basti, I’m using the shippingrate table, to calculate the delivery value by distance. 
I have a fixed delivery price and the table value.
However, in the mobile application the user is only informed in the cart about the 
fixed delivery price and not the price of the shippingrate table, the price of the shippingrate
is calculated only when the order closes ..
This is wrong because this price must be informed before Close the order so there are no surprises in the final price ..

 
 re order not working
