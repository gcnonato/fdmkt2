Ok, so as I have contacted you before, I need for the app the same 
feature that’s on the website, where people have to confirm they’re over 
18 before they proceed. How can I achieve that on the app?

hello pro iwant ask why customer cant see real img for driver see 
img: https://e.top4top.net/p_559wftcm1.png https://f.top4top.net/p_55924pf92.png


distance not computing in line
if ( $this->data['transaction_type']=="delivery" && is_numeric($merchant_delivery_distance) ){		


Then the time zone on my server would be the same for Web orders and orders from the Mobile App. 
On the Web, there is no A.S.A.P. choice when restaurants are in Pre-Order mode because they are closed,
 but on the Mobile App, the A.S.A.P. function is still available.

 
 hi basti, i’m glad you are updating this app for the search by area/neighborhood. please also add the ajax search 
 for restaurant result and food items. so user scroll down more restaurants will 
 loaded for restaurant list page and same for food menu item page. so we don’t have to 
 limit the number of search result to only 50 restaurants and the app can also load much faster too. 
 hope this request will be in this update! thanks
 
 
 Possible to save the cart even when closing app and then coming back? Possible to save 
 if accidentally going back to restaurant list (lets say that someone clicks back by accident 
 after adding 10 items. Frustrating. Or if they change their mind and then want to come back to finish order.
  Customers will get annoyed with it being lost now.
 
 
 combined cart item
 
 You could include in the next update, the multi-language FAQS, 
 the terms and conditions (which are mandatory in Android, include within the Apps) 
 and a customer support chat.
 
 You have customers that do not understand how to add a credit card when using offline credit card
Little + on the top right really needs to have a text explanation as to what to do. Can you add some
 text to tell people what to do and then once you add the card tell them to tap the card number and then select card?
 
 Will you be able to add a message to the menu page of the merchant, below the restaurant title? 
 (The merchant can edit this announcement in the back-end, Just as they can edit Holiday Close Message)

So merchant can publish some important reminder about their restaurant, such as: order deadline, 
delivery time information. So that customers can clearly know when to order meals. 
Especially for some restaurants that set the order deadline for delivery order.

I have provided some examples: 1. https://screenshot.net/zh/nmexioy 2. https://screenshot.net/zh/ngxzidj


This is what it should look like going by the driver app 
http://prntscr.com/gzacn6 That way the customer can see the driver 
going to restaurant before coming to him
