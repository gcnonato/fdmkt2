1. Hi mate is there any possible to add sponcered ribbon in the mobile app?


Hi Mate, There is no delete/edit option for review in mobile 
like in web and also whenever anyone reply it only show in web but not in mobile

And also there is no Information, Promo section in mobile just like in web. 
So that customer can see Information and Voucher. If possible can you 
tell how to add this in Merchant info section, because these basic
 things are very important and also the Edit/Delete and Reply of review.
