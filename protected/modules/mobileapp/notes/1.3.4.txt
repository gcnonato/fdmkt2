i have added “Date of Birth’ as Registration custom fields and now it appears on 
the website while registration. However, while creating an account through mobile app, 
“Date of Birth” filed does not appear at all. Please suggest me what to do??


add delivery fee on search result


Bug: When creating account on phone with phone verification, and then placing first order, the phone number that you have verified doesn’t show automatically on the page where you need to write the shipping address


Loyalty points is enabled, but when customer places a review he doesn’t earn points but if he places review on website he earns points…
Same for creating account, doesn’t work on mobile
Same for first order



Does this fix also contain the Iphone push notification bug? (where the 2 push notification badge doesn’t leave)
 and where the popup doesn’t show inside the app.
(on android everything is working fine!)

4. just suggestions for next update: 
4.1 star rating: entering number 1 to 5 is not as nice as having an images of 
5 grey stars for users to tape and rate number of star they want.

 4.2 improve visibility of the election box for delivery option and 
 payment option so users easily know there is an option for them to choose. 
 currently is deepen in the white app background.


there is a problem in verificating a new account on the mobile app.
after new user sending the registration form, they will be redirected to the verification page to enter the code they received on their email ( I have not tried the mobile phone verification). usually user need to close the app first to retrieve the code from their email app. when reopening the app again, the verification page has gone. there seems nowhere to find the verification page on the app.


allow the customer to see the menu even if
merchatn is closed

1. there must be a retriction on customer for using a voucher. it is the voucher can not be applied if the merchant 
has an offer. this will avoid a double discount.

2. if the merchant has an offer of free delivery on order over certain amount, and the customer order is reaching the condition, so the customer will not be able to apply any voucher


Yes, this function you have one here.

I have enabled, google capache on sign up form, and also i have made one custom coloum , in admin setting, 
for custom field, After that i can see custom field in signup in website, But do not see 
in customer mobile app, Please let me know what i need to do to see effect on mobile apps also ,
 Even i updated the database in admin and customer app option Both . Thanks


For mobile app update, pls add feature to view direction to the merchant location (google map navigation).
 For review feature, add function for merchant to be able to response to each review. Sorry i ask this in this item


no problem. pls just solve the verification issue first since that is very important. clicking a link on email for verification would solve the issue instead of copying the code and put it back to the app. i don’t know if u still remember this issue since this issue has been arround for months


while u are working to implement other buyers feature requests, maybe i may request one too.
 that is a view direction feature from the customer location to the restaurant
 (like the driver app). a floating action button over the map canvas (on merchant info) would be nice for this purpose.



Sure, see below:
1) from Seamless App https://gyazo.com/278a41cc1911598f8835a07c56440767 https://gyazo.com/984b9ba238125c91e96753e37e12a28f https://gyazo.com/2673f1e2307c41be156bae4f94c066f4

2) beyond menu app:
https://gyazo.com/b66aed6e8885d8af95db98731321d3bf

You can try all these apps in Android or iOS phones: Seamless, Grubhub, beyondmenu, eat24, etc.. they are working in very similar way on that. which is the best way in term of mobile users. (less click, less pages back and forth).

Hello Basti, Can you please confirm the type which we need to select while creating API as i think google has changed something again. If we choose web server then it asks for IP and as we are using shared server how can we populate IP? Does it works if we select HTTP.
